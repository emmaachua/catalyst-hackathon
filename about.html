            <h2>About Mountain Children Home</h2>
            <p>Nestled in the jungle of Dadagaun, Kathmandu, lies Mountain Children Home. It is a place of warmth, joy, and laughter, but life for the 32 children who live there is not easy.</p>
            <p>They all came to Mountain Home at a young age when they lost both of their parents and no other relatives took them in. As soon as they stepped foot into Mountain Home though, they were no longer alone. But they still brave untold challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hour-long walks to school through a night-time jungle</li>
                    <li>A catastrophic earthquake that flattened their home</li>
                    <li>Constant food and financial insecurity</li>
                </ul>
